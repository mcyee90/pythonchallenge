Python Challenge

There are three different python scripts designed to do different things.

1. PyParagraph:
PyParagraph is designed to input a paragraph then count the number of words, sentences, letters, including letters per word and sentenece length. It does so by doing splits by punctuation and counting then taking the length of the array. Then splitting each on by space to get words and counting again and then splitting each word into letters and counting the letters.

2. PyPoll
Pypoll is designed to look at CSV data for an election that includes who a certain voter voted for. The scripted is designed to go throguh each vote one at a time. If the candidate has not been voted for yet, it adds the name to the dictionary. If the candidate has been voted for, it adds one to the tally. It also calculates the length of the entire dataset and uses the length to calculate the percentage of votes earned by a particular candidate. Lastly, it looks at who received the most votes and determines the winner.

3. PyBank
PyBank takes in input data including month and monthly revenue earned. A loop is made to look at the current month. It calculates the difference between two months of revenue and then looks to find the greatest and the smallest revenue difference. It also looks at the average revenue change between the months and the timeframe for the comparison. Lastly, it summarizes the report and prints the outcome.
